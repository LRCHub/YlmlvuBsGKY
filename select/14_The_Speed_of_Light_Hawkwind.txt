Speed of light (demo di Transdimentional
Man)

Where the speed of light breaks thro'
Changing shapes distort the view
Red rimmed stars, teardrops of light
I can vanish into the night

With laser eyes I will awake
Panic is the rule I make
Trace my background identikit
A source of light which shall emit

I see what no one foretells
I can travel down to hell
I know what is often said
Written in the book of the dead

I can travel anyway
With my energising ray
And I'll visit in your room
Appearing from within the gloom
Watch me take you in your dreams
Cascading iridescent light beams
Fingers curling in the sun
Reaching for what has begun

Suddenly I hear all your lies
See all the secrets of 1000 eyes
But you may laugh or gasp for breath
What is life and what is death
