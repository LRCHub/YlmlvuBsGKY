Speed of light
Speed of light
I got to keep the wheel,
gotta keep it turnin'
I got to feel everybody's
kinda livin' crazy
They walk the stree of desire
movin' much too slow
I got a burnin' fire
Never care
if you're sorry for me
You better hold on tighter
I'm reachin' higher higher
you'll never stop me
Speed of light
I'm ragin' all around
In the night you can feel me
Speed of light
Go flashin' in your heart
like your blood is burnin'
Speed of light
I'm always on the sun
In my mind I just feel the
Speed of light
I got to keep the wheel,
gotta keep it turnin'
This time is gonna be cool,
and every day is my day
Can you feel no panic at all,
take off my horror hood
I got a burnin' fire
Never care
if you're sorry for me
You better hold on tighter
I'm reachin' higher higher
you'll never stop me
Speed of light
I'm ragin' all around
In the night you can feel me
Speed of light
Go flashin' in your heart
like your blood is burnin'
Speed of light
I'm always on the sun
In my mind I just feel the
Speed of light
I got to keep the wheel,
gotta keep it turnin'
This time is gonna be cool,
and every day is my day
(Speed of light)
Can you feel no panic at all,
take off my horror hood
(Speed of light)
You better hold on tighter
I'm reachin' higher higher
you'll never stop me
Speed of light
I'm ragin' all around
In the night you can feel me
Speed of light
Go flashin' in your heart
like your blood is burnin'
Speed of light
I'm always on the sun
In my mind I just feel the
Speed of light
I got to keep the wheel,
gotta keep it turnin'
