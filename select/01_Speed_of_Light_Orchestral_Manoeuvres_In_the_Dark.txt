The speed of light slows down
As the feather hits the ground
And nothing else gets through
It's always faster than it sounds.
The star that shone so bright
Will be eclipsed tonight
When you kiss the satelite.
'Cause there was someplace you
And you alone, believed that a life
Could be this way
It don't seem right
To spend tonight as you did today.
If I had known that you would call
If I could dream that you would fall
If I could change these thoughts around
I would have stayed at home tonight.
There's nothing that you can do
To make this all brand-new
Nothing here to save
To make it go away.
You've never been so wrong.
So how can you ignore
When a fall from grace so high
Should never take so long
And say goodbye,
As you did today.
So the speed of light remains
Ever-constantly the same
Begin tonight as it did today.
